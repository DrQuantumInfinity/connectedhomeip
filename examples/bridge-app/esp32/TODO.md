Test the light
    -hard code inject a serial message
    -may lead to moooore

why brightness/hsv not work

Test multicluster devices
    -like how does a RGB and temperature light at the same time work?

ESPnow class
    -provide an array of clusters to the device
    -bidirectional serialization from ESPNowMessage to cluster readers/writers
    -makes unique device types obsolete

Figure out mode clusters

linux bridge

Thermostat

other circuit board

persistent device detection
